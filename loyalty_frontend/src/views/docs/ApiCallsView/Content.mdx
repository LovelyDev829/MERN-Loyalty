# Api Calls

## How can I make an AJAX call?
You can use any library you like. We decided to use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> since it allows us to create instances. Another good alternative could be <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andris9/fetch">Fetch</a>.

## Example
Since we keep up to date with the latest updates of React, our product uses functional components with React Hooks, but this can be applied to Class components.

```jsx
function CustomerListView() {
  const classes = useStyles();
  const isMountedRef = useIsMountedRef();
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState(null);

  const getCustomers = useCallback(() => {
    axios
      .get('/api/management/customers')
      .then((response) => {
        if (isMountedRef.current) {
          setCustomers(response.data.customers);
        }
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Handle error
      });
  }, [isMountedRef]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getCustomers();
  }, [getCustomers]);

  return (
    // Render data
  );
}
```

## Request interceptors

Using Axios we were able to integrate <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter">Axios Mock Adapter</a> to simulate real server calls. To archive that, you have to create an Axios instante and use it whenever you make a request call. Now you can extend your instance and add Axios Mock Adapter to listen for requests and return custom data.

## Removing existing request interceptos

There are two ways:

1. Simply use a new instance of Axios
2. Remove the interecept listener existing in `src/mock` folder.

### Adding request interceptors

It takes ony a few seconds to add a new call listener. The interceptor has a similar format to Express JS, for example:

```js
import mock from 'src/utils/mock';

mock.onGet('/api/management/invoices').reply(200, {
  invoices: [
    { id: 1, total: 32.43 },
    { id: 2, total: 67.00 }
  ]
});
```
