# Routing

The entire routing is based on the `react-router` and `react-router-dom` modules.

## Lazy loading routes

Most React apps will have their files "bundled" using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a "bundle". This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.

To reduce bundle size, we use the new `lazy` and `Suspense` React methods with the dynamic import() syntax.

```jsx
import React, {
  lazy,
  Suspense
} from 'react';
import LoadingScreen from 'src/components/LoadingScreen';

function Routes() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingScreen />}>
      <Switch>
        <Route
          exact
          path="/404"
          component={lazy(() => import('src/views/pages/ErrorView'))}
        />
      </Switch>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

`lazy` takes a function that must call a dynamic `import()`. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

The lazy component should then be rendered inside a `Suspense` component, which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while weâ€™re waiting for the lazy component to load.

## Protecting routes

We created route wrappers to check the user credentials before displaying the route content. For example, we only allow the dashboard rendering only if the user is logged in and login/register pages for unauthencated users. This can be extended and add one extra layer of security by checking for user role. It's up to you to decide your protection method.
